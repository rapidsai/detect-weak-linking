# Contributing to detect-weak-linking

Contributions to detect-weak-linking fall into the following categories:

1. To report a bug, request a new feature, or report a problem with documentation, please file an
   [issue](https://github.com/rapidsai/detect-weak-linking/issues/new/choose) describing the problem or new feature
   in detail. The RAPIDS team evaluates and triages issues, and schedules them for a release. If you
   believe the issue needs priority attention, please comment on the issue to notify the team.
2. To propose and implement a new feature, please file a new feature request
   [issue](https://github.com/rapidsai/detect-weak-linking/issues/new/choose). Describe the intended feature and
   discuss the design and implementation with the team and community. Once the team agrees that the
   plan looks good, go ahead and implement it, using the [code contributions](#code-contributions)
   guide below.
3. To implement a feature or bug fix for an existing issue, please follow the [code
   contributions](#code-contributions) guide below. If you need more context on a particular issue,
   please ask in a comment.

As contributors and maintainers to this project, you are expected to abide by the RAPIDS's code of
conduct. More information can be found at:
[Contributor Code of Conduct](https://docs.rapids.ai/resources/conduct/).

## Code contributions

### Your first issue

1. Follow the guide at the bottom of this page for
   [Setting up your build environment](#setting-up-your-build-environment).
2. Find an issue to work on. The best way is to look for the
   [good first issue](https://github.com/rapidsai/detect-weak-linking/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
   or [help wanted](https://github.com/rapidsai/detect-weak-linking/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
   labels.
3. Comment on the issue stating that you are going to work on it.
4. Create a fork of the repository and check out a branch with a name that
   describes your planned work. For example, `fix-documentation`.
5. Write code to address the issue or implement the feature.
6. Add unit tests and unit benchmarks.
7. [Create your pull request](https://github.com/rapidsai/detect-weak-linking/compare). To run continuous integration (CI) tests without requesting review, open a draft pull request.
8. Verify that CI passes all [status checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks).
   Fix if needed.
9. Wait for other developers to review your code and update code as needed.
10. Once reviewed and approved, a RAPIDS developer will merge your pull request.

If you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issues and ask for clarification!

### Seasoned developers

Once you have gotten your feet wet and are more comfortable with the code, you can look at the
prioritized issues for our next release in our
[project boards](https://github.com/rapidsai/detect-weak-linking/projects).

**Note:** Always look at the release board that is
[currently under development](https://docs.rapids.ai/maintainers) for issues to work on. This is
where RAPIDS developers also focus their efforts.

Look at the unassigned issues, and find an issue to which you are comfortable contributing. Start
with _Step 3_ above, commenting on the issue to let others know you are working on it. If you have
any questions related to the implementation of the issue, ask them in the issue instead of the PR.

#### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

* Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
